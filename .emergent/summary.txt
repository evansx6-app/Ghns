<analysis>
The trajectory details an extensive, iterative development process for a radio streaming application. The AI engineer systematically addressed numerous UI/UX enhancements, bug fixes, and performance optimizations. Key efforts included refactoring the  for consistent track data and artwork display, refining the 's scrolling logic and visual states, and ensuring robust  and  functionality across devices, especially iOS. Critical deployment blockers related to hardcoded URLs were resolved early on. Significant work also went into improving casting functionality () for reliable track info and artwork updates without audio interruption, optimizing performance for older devices, and meticulously adjusting desktop/mobile layouts for aesthetic and functional improvements. Each change involved code edits, service restarts, and screenshot verifications, demonstrating a thorough, user-feedback-driven workflow.

<product_requirements>
The user envisioned a radio streaming application with rich UI/UX, built from a GitHub repository. The application needed to display track metadata, album artwork, and recent tracks with an aesthetic cassette deck feel.

**Current Product State & Key Features:**
*   **Audio Player Visuals:** Features an LED level meter, album artwork with visual effects (bezel, scanline, vignette), greyscaling when paused. Robust visualiser on all devices, including iPhone, with fallback.
*   **Text Scrolling:**  shows left-justified title/artist on separate lines. Conditional scrolling (for long text) with seamless right-to-left looping and 1-second pause. Paused state is dimmer (45% opacity).
*   **Branding & Theming:** Merchandise and Made with emergent removed. Dynamic background gradients from album art. Consistent orange accent color for icons, footer, and play/record buttons. Top bar text is silver on black chrome.
*   **Track Information:** Consistent display of track title/artist, preventing data loss.
*   **Buttons:** Rectangular play/record buttons, black with bright orange outline, play button has shimmer when paused.
*   **Layout:** Desktop has smaller album art on the left, with Sleep Timer, Lyrics, Cast buttons, LED meters, and play button on the right. Consistent vertical spacing. Mobile layout places LCD Display at the top, artwork below it, then controls.
*   **Artwork Handling:** Radio station logo as fallback. Optimized loading with preloading; artwork persists reliably.

<pending_tasks>
- No explicit pending tasks were identified at the end of the provided trajectory, as the last user request was being addressed by the AI.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently working on optimizing the application's loading performance for older devices, specifically including album artwork. The user's request was to Optimise loading for older devices, including album artwork (Chat Message 618).

Immediately before this summary request, the AI had identified the  component as a key area for improvement. The AI started to add slow device detection and optimization logic directly into  (Chat Message 620, 621). This is part of a broader performance optimization effort that also included lazy loading, adaptive polling, and disabling heavy animations, as seen in earlier work on . The current focus is on making image loading more efficient, especially for devices with limited resources.
