The AI engineer's trajectory details the iterative development of a radio streaming application, focusing heavily on UI/UX and bug resolution. Initial work addressed branding removal and API connection issues through cache invalidation. Significant effort was dedicated to evolving the audio visualiser, which transitioned through various styles (equalizer, retro, LED meters), and enhancing track information display into a sophisticated, customizable LCD component. The overall player design was refined to mimic classic audio devices. The top bar, play button, and record button underwent multiple stylistic iterations, involving dynamic color changes, shimmer effects, and fixed color schemes. Recurring issues with text scrolling, particularly for long titles and artist names, were a persistent challenge, alongside artwork fallback and API connectivity. The engineer consistently used screenshots and console logs for debugging, adapting to user feedback for continuous improvement, and engaging a troubleshoot agent for infrastructure-related problems.

<product_requirements>
The user initiated development of a radio streaming application based on a GitHub repository, requesting extensive UI/UX enhancements and bug fixes. The application displays track metadata, artwork, and recent tracks.

**Current Product State & Key Features:**
*   **Audio Player Visuals:** Features a cassette deck LED level meter (horizontal, L/R channels, always visible). Album artwork is displayed on a screen with bezel, glass, scanline, and vignette effects, greyscaling/dimming on standby.
*   **Text Scrolling:** Initially, titles scrolled, then forced scrolling was implemented. Later, continuous seamless looping was requested for titles and long artist names. This feature has been a recurrent point of refinement.
*   **Branding & Theming:** T-shirts merchandise removed, Made with emergent branding removed. Dynamic background gradients based on album art colors. Consistent orange accent color for various icons and footer text, play/record buttons. Top bar text is silver on a black chrome background.
*   **Track Information Display:** An LCD style display () shows track info. It has evolved to two separate lines for title and artist, left-justified, with reduced font sizes. Conditional scrolling for long text was implemented, but its behavior has been inconsistent, leading to continuous debugging.
*   **Play Button:** Rectangular, black with a bright orange outline, featuring a shimmer effect when paused.
*   **Record Button:** Matches the play button style: black with an orange outline.
*   **Layout:** Desktop view has smaller album art, with Sleep Timer, Lyrics, and Cast buttons placed beneath the artwork, followed by LED meters and the play button. Vertical spacing is consistent between elements.
*   **Artwork Handling:** Fallback artwork uses the radio station's logo. Optimized image loading implemented.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently debugging the continuous scrolling for long track titles and artist names within the  component. The user explicitly requested that Long track information is not scrolling (Chat Message 589).

Previously, the agent had already implemented:
*   A two-line display for title and artist, left-justified, with reduced font sizes (Chat Message 574-588).
*   Conditional scrolling logic designed to activate when text is too long (Chat Message 558-563), then reverted to always-on scrolling, then reverted back to conditional and left-justified.
*   The scrolling threshold was recently reduced from 30 to 25 characters (Chat Message 596) to make it more likely to trigger.

However, despite these changes, the text Look What You Made Me Do (24 characters) and Taylor Swift (12 characters) were observed to be static in recent screenshots, indicating the scrolling mechanism is still not functioning as expected. The  state has been verified to be true. The agent's last action was to confirm that the text length for the current track was below the (newly lowered) threshold (Chat Message 595-596), and then observed the scrolling still not working in screenshots (Chat Message 600). The current focus is on adding console logging to further debug why the scrolling animation isn't visible or looping correctly.

<optional_next_step>
Add console logging to the  component to thoroughly debug why the continuous scrolling for long titles and artist names is not activating or rendering correctly.
