The AI engineer's work began by exploring an existing full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application, then cloning a GitHub repository provided by the user. After initial setup and dependency installation, the core work involved numerous UI/UX enhancements and bug fixes for a radio streaming application.

Initially, the focus was on implementing dynamic visual effects: spotlights and later an ambilight effect around the audio player, with colors linked to album art. This evolved through several iterations (gradual animation, LED-like lights, density adjustments, spacing, and glow intensity) based on user feedback.

Concurrently, the engineer addressed text scrolling behavior, ensuring titles scroll only when too long, from right-to-left, and artist names remain static. T-shirts was removed from a merchandise link. Performance optimizations included lazy loading images and API caching. Critical bug fixes targeted graphic glitches on mobile, album art loading issues (especially on Safari/iOS), visualiser functionality on iOS, and the overall PWA install prompt. The engineer also removed made with emergent branding, which initially caused page loading issues, requiring a more targeted removal approach. The latest issue being addressed is an API connection issue and top banner styling.

<product_requirements>
The user initiated the task by providing a GitHub repository URL, later clarifying the need to clone it and implement several enhancements. The core product is a radio streaming application that plays music and displays track metadata (title, artist, album art) along with recently played tracks.

**Key Requirements & Implementations:**
1.  **Audio Player Visuals:**
    *   **Spotlights/Ambilight:** Initially, add spotlights, then transition to an ambilight effect around the audio player container, dynamically linked to album art colors. This underwent several refinements:
        *   Gradual animation for the ambilight gradient.
        *   Make lights look like individual, smaller, denser LEDs.
        *   Uniform LED spacing, positioned slightly behind the container with a small glow.
        *   Finally, remove LEDs and revert to a continuous, colorful glow around the edge, with reduced intensity.
2.  **Text Scrolling:**
    *   Fix titles in the audio player not scrolling. Ensure all titles, fallback text, and Legendary Radio from Scotland always scroll.
    *   Modify scrolling to start from the right for long titles; artist names should not scroll.
    *   Center track titles, only scrolling from right-to-left if too long for the container.
    *   Left-justify track information text only in the recently played container.
3.  **Branding:** Remove T-shirts from the merchandise link. Remove any made with emergent branding.
4.  **Fallback Artwork:** Show a provided  image when album artwork is missing.
5.  **Performance:** Optimize loading of album art and the entire webpage (e.g., lazy loading, caching).
6.  **Bug Fixes & Compatibility:**
    *   Fix graphic glitches in the recently played container on mobile scrolling.
    *   Fix audio player album art not changing immediately on track change.
    *   Ensure visualiser, lighting effects, and PWA install prompt work correctly on iOS devices.
    *   Fix album art and visualiser not loading on Safari/iOS, addressing CORS and Web Audio API issues.
    *   Fix playback failing on iOS.
    *   Adjust glow intensity around the audio player container (multiple iterations for subtlety).
    *   Fix general title scrolling issues (RTL direction).
    *   Address an API connection issue and remove a translucent layer behind text in the top banner, adding text shadow.

<pending_tasks>
-   Continue debugging and resolving the API connection issue.
-   Complete the styling updates for the top banner, specifically applying shadow to the text.
-   Further verification of cross-browser and cross-device compatibility, especially on older iOS versions if issues persist.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing two related issues:
1.  **API connection issue:** Despite initial checks showing the backend logs and frontend API calls (via ) are working, the user reports a page will not load issue, which was previously attributed to an overly aggressive branding removal script. The engineer is now investigating if there's a different API connection issue or frontend cache problem. The latest action was to identify the  function in  to potentially disable caching for it.
2.  **Top banner styling:** The user requested to remove a clear layer behind the text in the top banner and use shadows on the banner text instead. The engineer identified the  and  classes in  as the clear layer and has edited the file to remove these and add text shadows.

The engineer is in the middle of modifying  to address the API connection issue by clearing or modifying the cache mechanism for the current track.

<optional_next_step>
I will complete the modification to  to update the API caching for the current track and then restart the frontend.
