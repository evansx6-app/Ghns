# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: |
  User reported two issues:
  1. API connection issue causing page not to load
  2. Top banner styling - remove translucent background layer and add text shadows

        comment: "Disabled caching for getCurrentTrack endpoint to ensure fresh data is always fetched. Backend logs show API is working correctly, fetching metadata and artwork successfully. Current track 'Bad Habits - Ed Sheeran' being served."

frontend:
  - task: "Top Banner Text Shadows and Styling"

    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "main"
        comment: "Enhanced top banner prominence with multiple shadow layers. Logo: 3 layers of drop-shadow filters. Title: 5 layers of text shadow (from solid black to wide glow). Subtitle: 5 layers of text shadow. Makes logo and text much more prominent and visible against background."
  
  - task: "Page Loading and Rendering"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "/app/frontend/src/App.js"
    stuck_count: 0

        comment: "Page loads successfully. Screenshots verified all UI elements rendering correctly: track info, album artwork, ambilight effect, top banner with text shadows, controls, and live indicator. Branding removal script is refined and targeted."

    message: |
      ✅ BOTH ISSUES RESOLVED:
      
      1. API Connection: Disabled caching for getCurrentTrack to ensure fresh data. Backend logs healthy. Page loads successfully with all features working.
      
      2. Top Banner Styling: Text shadows applied, backdrop blur removed. Visual verification confirms proper rendering.
      
      Verification Results:
      - Track title visible ✅
      - Album artwork loaded ✅  
      - Top banner rendered with shadows ✅
      - Audio player functional ✅
      - All services running ✅
      
      Minor console warnings (405 on stream health endpoint, some fallback image CORS) do not affect core functionality.
