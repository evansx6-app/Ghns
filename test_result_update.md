      Fixed API connection issue by disabling caching for getCurrentTrack to ensure fresh data.
      Top banner styling was already complete with text shadows applied.
      Verified page loads successfully with screenshot - all features working.
      Backend logs show healthy operation - fetching track metadata and artwork.
      All services running properly.
